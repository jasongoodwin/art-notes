# General ableton
- use the samples folder on the right
- can convert simpler to sampler w/ right click convert

- freeze track, copy to resample.
- check out the track delay - you can shift a whole track back or forward-sexp-function

# Laying down the percussion

- He uses one track (drum rack) and puts multiple instruments in it, then resamples by freezing and copying the audio to another track. The eq etc is done inside the instrument in the drum rack
- Described not as two step

## Kick
- starts with 3 kick triplet.
- starts with the textural kick (the noisy part), kills the low end
- fills in the low end with another kick that has the bass body. kills the high end
- crossover aroun ~180 hz
- adjust the decay in sampler, esp low end

## Snare
- on one and third half beat
- layers snare w/ clap, eq them together
- Resample
- Add whitenoise over it (gate it or use an envelope) for a little sizzle and air
- or an open hat

## Hats
- Hats placed on 8ths that aren't occupied by snare or kick.
- Play with decay. You can move the envelope/fade in the sampler in the drum rack
- Layer a different hat over the kick. Start quiet and bring it up until audible

## Shaker over kick
- Throwing a shaker over a kick can give some extra sparkle.
- Play with the track delay to make it hit a bit before the kick.

## Rides and Tambourines
- Can be used to accentuate kicks and snares.
- Try a tambourine over kicks
- Rides across all of the 8ths.
- Pitch it way up
- Play it super quiet just to fill out the air

## Breaks
- Throwing in an amen
- Ditch the kick and snare
- Use the rides and fast shuffles to fill in more of the space.
- Pitch it to get it sitting right
- Shelf out the freqs you don't need
- Again starting quiet and bringing it up
- Use the percussive elements to add swing, hamanness back in
- think break has a couple nice hits - pitch it up 4 or 5 semitones
- Stranjah uses addictive drums instead of breaks often. supplementing worked well!
- Check out icicle addictive drums tutorial?

## Ghost hits
- Take some small percussive rim shot
- Throw it on the last couple 16th half beats .............x.x

## Supercharger GT
- He turns saturation update-leim-list-function. Really likes it.
- Just analog style saturation to heat it up a bit

## Wrapping it up
- Resample the bus for future use.
- Add warp markers
- Slice to midi by using the warp markers (it's an option)
- Can resequence it to two step or whatever at that point

# Bass Lines
- serum used in the sesh
- Drops the bass in on the snare for that two step vibe

## Basic shape of sub bass
- starts w/ square (spire's bsod square)
- LP filter added to take out the crap so you have a sub bass that has a little bit of harmonic quality
- (Can play w/ the lfo to give it some shape)

## Attack
- Assign lfo (envelope) to global pitch
- Single envelope to drop from +1 octave to 0 on key press to get a notable attack on the sub bass.
- (make it really short)

## mid Layer - synth
- Try the digital waveforms.

## mid Layer - layered noise
- Noise generator turned on in second serum instruments
- Highpassed the noise
- Buss it and throw saturation on it (NI supercharger gt)
- play around with the noise modulation

# Melodic component
- Uses spire for a lot of the melodic components
- Use arpeggiated lines (3 notes or whatever) if stuck
- Polyrhythms (again, 3s) stuffed into a couple bar loop
- semitone step for moodiness

# Strings
- Played the triplet used in the arp (w/ semitone - makes it pretty moody/dissonant)

# Second bass element
- adds variation to the bass by dropping in a second bass
- built similarlarly to the first - take the BSOD square, cut it and moves the lp filter up w/ resonance

---------- moved onto arrangement

# Arrangement
- drops from scene view into the 49bar
- copies the sections less bass back through the previous 3/4 of song (1-48)
- says he has been doing 32 bar intros to get right into it
- Once the track starts to build up, make sure you keep re-organizing things to keep the order under control
- Color code related tracks, layers etc.

## Transition
- drops to silence before the drop and puts a riser in
- Rev for kontakt
- Vengenance essential club sounds has some impacts to use at the start of a breakdown
- At the end of a section before a breakdown, you can try to throw in a break
- Before drop can try filtering drums in w/ HP filter rolling down

## Second drop
- More functional - DJ is going to mix out into another tune
- Take out some of the noisier elements to give the DJ room to mix into the next track

## Intro
- Keep the energy level lower in the pecussion in the intro (Leave out the ghost hits)
- Try low passing the intro

## Adding variation
- Pause edit:Have the kick at the start of the pattern then deactivate the notes in the first quarter of the bar (highlight and press 0 to deactivate notes)
  - Record Reverse snare reverb and put it in the pause edit before the snare hits
  - add a fade on it so when the drums pause it sucks you back in
- Try more pause edits to get different ideas about the different rhythmic possibilities
- Double kick at start of 8 bar, or in the last bars.
- Recommends valhalla vintage reverb

## Automation shortcuts
- Highlight section, drop it to add points on the lines
- Hold control while adjusting to keep the break point snapped on the lines

## Quick Master
- Mushroom pusher

# Saturation
- super saturator
- saturn

# Using DBlue Glitch - it's free
- Just record a bunch of shit on the drum tracks
- Then you can go edit it in.

# Atmosphere
- Kontakt instruments (Scanner)
- Consider using modulation like on the pitch with a bunch of reverb to create atmos too
